# Accelerate DevOps with GitHub

**Enhance Software Delivery Performance with GitHub Issues, Projects, Actions, and Advanced Security**

This is the companion repository for my book [Accelerate DevOps with GitHub](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4DW7NSL/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_B4DR80D2BBERYNSQ5V9C). You can find all hands-on labs and other examples from the book here. I also provide all the links and references from the chapters.

## Part 1: Lean Management and Collaboration

In Part 1 you will learn how to reduce ballast from your development process and move to a lean and collaborative way of working that allows your teams to accelerate their value delivery. You’ll learn how to use GitHub to work together from everywhere effectively and use work insights and the right metrics to optimize your engineering productivity.

### Chapter 1: Metrics that Matter

### Chapter 5: The Influence of Open and Inner Source on Software Delivery Performance

In this chapter I explain the history of free and open-source software and why it has become so important over the last years. I will explain the impact it can have on your engineering velocity and how you can use the principles of open source for better cross-team collaboration in your company (inner source).
The chapter will cover:
- History of free and open-source software
- The difference between open source and open development
- Benefits of embracing open source for companies
- Implementing an open-source strategy
- Open and inner source
- Importance for insourcing
- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors)

Featured open-source projects to sponsor:

- [curl](https://github.com/curl) is the example for an organization that you can sponsor. Curl is used every day by thousands of developers worldwide (sponsor [the project here](https://github.com/sponsors/curl)).
- [Dennis Doomen](https://github.com/dennisdoomen) is the example for `Sponsor tiers`. He is the author of [FluentAssertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions) - a .NET library I use in most of my C# projejcts ([sponsor Dennis here](https://github.com/sponsors/dennisdoomen)). 
- [Jan De Dobbeleer](https://github.com/jandedobbeleer) is the example for `Sponsorship goals`. He is the maintainer of [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) - a highly customizable and extensible prompt theme engine for PowerShell ([sponsor Jan here](https://github.com/sponsors/JanDeDobbeleer)).

At the time writing the book, `GitHub Sponsors` was new and I worked with some of the mainters mentioned to set this up in a good way. So not all projects made it here - for example [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), which I use every day and which was the inspiration for oh-my-posh.
