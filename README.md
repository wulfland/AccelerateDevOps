# Accelerate DevOps with GitHub

**Enhance Software Delivery Performance with GitHub Issues, Projects, Actions, and Advanced Security**

This is the companion repository for my book [Accelerate DevOps with GitHub](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4DW7NSL/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_B4DR80D2BBERYNSQ5V9C). You can find all hands-on labs and other examples from the book here. I also provide all the links and references from the chapters.

## Part 1: Lean Management and Collaboration

In Part 1 you will learn how to reduce ballast from your development process and move to a lean and collaborative way of working that allows your teams to accelerate their value delivery. You’ll learn how to use GitHub to work together from everywhere effectively and use work insights and the right metrics to optimize your engineering productivity.

### Chapter 1: Metrics that Matter

In this chapter I explain how to measure engineering velocity and developer productivity and how to make your DevOps acceleration measurable.
The following topics will are covered in this chapter:
-	Why Accelerate?
-	Engineering Velocity
-	High Performance Companies
-	Measuring metrics that matter
-	The SPACE of Developer Productivity
-	Objectives and Key-Results
